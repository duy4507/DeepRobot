This notebook was used to generate the results of the agent that is only
allowed to do discrete actions. 

By allowing only discrete actions, we can see that the agent is highly 
sensitive to the number of actions available. The average return is highly 
sensitive to the action 'do nothing' as we can see that the agent is reaching
the flag more accuratly when he is only able to move forward or backward.
